# BackEnd Caos

Do you ever had like an Idea, but is always on background?, slowly growing, sometimes showing at the wrong time and the mind just sent her back, locked up. but is still there *rising up*.

Gladly for me, all this kind of ideas are good or from good nature, but the characteristic is that they are really difficult to accomplish, take tons of steps and we generally think we are not ready yet.

But one day . . .
They just explode, your mind is barely handle-ling what is going on, you that that "Eureka" moment if you ever had one. 

*Be Prepared*

Because you need to push yourself over and over again, trying your best or what is posible at the time, but **DO NOT LOSE THE MOMENTUM**, keep it there, like a desilusi√≥n you have to keep running, linda setting yourself on fire.

*Be Kind*

*But be brave too!*
